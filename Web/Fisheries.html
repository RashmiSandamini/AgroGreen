                    Sri Lanka, surrounded with warm and nutrient-filled waters
                    and filled with many rivers and lakes, enjoys a wealth of
                    fisheries opportunities. Having extensive coast-line as well
                    as numerous reservoirs and lakes throughout the country,
                    provide opportunities for both inland and deep-sea fishing.
                    This fisheries sector plays a key role in Sri Lanka’s social
                    and economic life and it consists of three main subsectors,
                    namely

                        Marine fisheries are of considerable social and economic
                        importance around the entire 1770 km of Sri Lanka’s
                        coastline.The marine area from shore to the edge of the

                        place in both sub-sectors. Marine fish production
                        contributes nearly 90% of the total fish catch, of which
                        the coastal fish catch is 60% while rest is from
                        deep-sea fish catching.

                        />Stilt fishing is one of the most interesting
                        traditional fishing methods in Sri Lanka which can be
                        seen in coastal fish catching. The beautiful sight of
                        fishermen perched branched poles as they fish skillfully
                        during dawn, noon and dusk; can now be commonly along
                        the southern coast in towns such as Koggala ,
                        Kaththaluwa, and Ahangama. Some fishers around the
                        coastal areas of the country use small boats or fishing
                        knots for catching fishes. Fishing activities take place
                        around the entire coast of the country, with landings
                        made, at 12 fishery harbor centers, several large and
                        small anchorages and as many as 700 village-level sites.

                        Sri Lanka has 103 perennial rivers, of which 23 river
                        basins are larger than 500 km2. Of the total area of
                        about 280 000 ha of inland water bodies, 160 000 ha are
                        lakes and ponds, while the rest (120 000 ha) consists of
                        lagoons and marshlands.
                    </p>
                    <br />

                    <p>
                        Inland reservoirs and tanks usually carry water all the
                        year round and other reservoirs and tanks are seasonal.
                        Brackish-water resources are situated in the coastal
                        belt in the form of estuaries, lagoons or marshes.
                        Although indigenous species like Labeo dissoumeari and
                        Puntius sarana are found in inland fish catches, their
                        commercial importance is quite low. Introduced fish
                        species, such as tilapias (Oreochromis mossambicus and
                        O. niloticus) dominates inland fish landings. Attempts
                        have also been made to introduce Indian and Chinese crap
                        species into reservoirs.

                        Therefore, the development of technology for the
                        production of high-quality fish of high demand species
                        and breeding of new varieties via hybridization has been

                        of the industry.
