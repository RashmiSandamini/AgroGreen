                <p>
                    Cultivation of flowers for various religious and cultural
                    festivals has existed in Sri Lanka for ages. It was only
                    after the British rule that floriculture really came into
                    practice not as an industry but mainly as a hobby for
                    pleasure. Later, with many new introductions of tropical and
                    sub tropical plants the trend was gradually passed down to
                    other levels of society.

                <p>
                    Floriculture in Sri Lanka started as an industry in 1970. It
                    has grown substantially during the last few years to become
                    one of Sri Lanka's major foreign exchange generating
                    ventures.

                    are the major areas where cut flowers are grown
                    commercially. Cut flowers grown in the country can be
                    divided into two main categories based on their temperature
                    requirements i.e.

                            for export, in the highlands of the Central Province
                            of Sri Lanka. Carnations are produced entirely from
                            imported planting materials and are graded according
                            to internationally accepted specifications for
                            export. The other species are commercially grown
                            mainly for the local market.

                            Carnations are much popular. Carnations are grown in
                            poly tunnels, covering more than 10 hectares, under
                            fully protected environments.

                        <p>
                            Roses are second to carnations and production is
                            limited to about 40,000 blossoms per annum. This is
                            mainly due to the highly expert conditions required
                            for cultivation and production. Roses are quite
                            popular in the local market also. Most of them are
                            supplied by small scale growers.

                            are the most popular tropical cut flowers which are
                            being grown commercially for exports as well as for
                            the local market. Anthuriums can be grown at
                            elevations up to 1500 metres above sea level, with
                            texture and the flossiness remarkably enhanced with
                            increase in elevation.The standard trade types in
                            the world market are the "Avo" lines i.e. Avo Nette,
                            Avo Ingrid, Avo Anneke. The improved standard types
                            e.g. Germa, Cuba, Fuego, Favoriet etc. are also
                            popular. Almost all plantations are either under
                            poly tunnels or structures with shade netting.
                            However, locally available materials are also used
                            under certain conditions to provide required shade
                            levels.

                            Gerberas are becoming popular among growers due to
                            the availability of a wide range of long lasting
                            cultivars produced by many modern breeding methods
                            and tissue culture. These cultivars can be broadly
                            categorised into three classes, namely Singles (such
                            as â€˜Fleurâ€™ and â€˜Apple Blossomâ€™), Doubles (such as
                            â€˜Marleenâ€™ and â€˜Hildegardâ€™), and Black Centres (such
                            as â€˜Fabioâ€™ and â€˜Rossetaâ€™). Pink, salmon, orange, red
                            and yellow are the popular colours in the market.
