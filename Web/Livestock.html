				<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
					<p>The livestock sector (including poultry) plays a vital part in food systems and livelihoods of rural households in Sri Lanka, 
					with more than 600,000 registered livestock farms, most of which are small-scale. 
					Sri Lanka's livestock sector mainly comprises <span style="color:#0052cc;font-weight:600">cattle, buffaloes, goats, sheep, pigs, and poultry</span>.
					The livestock species play very important economic and socio-cultural roles for the wellbeing of rural households which include food supply, 
					source of income, asset saving, source of employment, soil fertility, livelihoods, transport, agricultural traction, agricultural diversification
					and sustainable agricultural production.</p><br><br>
				<ul>
					<li><h2>Poultry</h2></li><br>
						<p>About 70 % of the contribution to the livestock sector in Sri Lanka is made up of chicken meat and eggs.  Poultry products are now the most 
						consumed source for animal protein in the diet of the average Sri Lankan as the industry today is in the hands of the private sector The village 
						chicken contributes to about 15 % of the total egg production in the nation.The village chicken is reared both in the rural and suburban areas,
						however, they are frequently found in the rural villages of Sri Lanka. The industry is capable of meeting a considerable amount of local requirements for chicken meat and eggs.</p><br>
